## Neural Network Charity Analysis - Results

## Data Preprocessing

### What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?

-  The target variable for the model was the "IS_SUCCESSFUL" category.

### What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?

-  The original model considered the following columns as features: EIN, NAME, APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, STATUS, INCOME_AMT, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS, ASK_AMT, IS_SUCCESSFUL.


### What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

-  For this model we removed the EIN and NAME columns.

## Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

### How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?

### Were you able to achieve the target model performance?

### What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
